# waiting-room-to-telerobot
This is three files of PHP code that is to put gamers to a camera telerobot in a virtual waitingroom, where they can wait for their turn, to remote control it.
It also needs a folder named "status" with (what I know now) four files named...

error : with 0 bytes
ip_block :  containing "{}" 
speltid :  with a number that stands for seconds a person can control a robot
återbesökare :  with 0 bytes


I can not upload the two empty files "error" and "återbesökare" so you need to make them your self, to run this project.

I get some of it to work.
Can anybody see why it does not work properly?

The code is about ten years old and was running on a debian linux server called FoxBoard.

with a webcam.

Now I need this PHP code to run on a wopsa.se  server to control some android robots
with an app called RoboCam.

Here is a video of one online LEGO EV3 omni robot.

You can try this code here.

I have set time to 20 seconds.
Who does it write out all seconds as a column at left?
And why does it write our camera options up right? 

So any tips?
